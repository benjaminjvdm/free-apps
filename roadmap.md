# Roadmap

Easiest:

    A/B Test Calculator: A relatively straightforward web app requiring basic statistical calculations and a user-friendly interface.
    CSV File Explorer: Primarily focused on data loading and simple visualization, making it a good starting point for data analysis.
    Cost-Benefit Analysis Calculator: Similar to the A/B Test Calculator in terms of complexity, but focused on financial calculations.

Moderate:

    Automated Data Cleaning Tool: Requires knowledge of common data cleaning techniques and libraries like Pandas for implementation.
    SQL Query Generator: Involves building a query interface and understanding SQL syntax for various data analysis tasks.
    Business Case Builder: Needs a structured template and potentially some form validation to guide users through the process.
    Project Timeline Visualization Tool: Can be done with libraries like Plotly or even basic JavaScript for Gantt chart creation.

Harder:

    Customer Segmentation Tool: Requires understanding of clustering algorithms or simple rule-based segmentation techniques.
    Model Performance Comparison Tool: Involves loading multiple models, evaluating them on datasets, and presenting results clearly.
    Anomaly Detection Dashboard: Requires time-series analysis knowledge and a suitable visualization library to display anomalies.
